import Breadcrumbs from './Breadcrumbs'

## Intent

Breadcrumbs are intended to provide users an understanding of where they are located in a rich information structure. They work well in situations where users may have clicked several layers deep, and would want to move back toward the top in linear steps.

## Using the Breadcrumbs Component

The `<Breadrumbs />` component accepts a number of different `children` props and will render them correctly:

* An array of comma-separated `<a>` tags
* An array of comma-separated `<Link />` components (React router)
* Hard-coded HTML `<a>` tags
* A combination of HTML and React router components

You do not need to wrap your code in `<li>` or `<ul>` elements. The proper markup is included in the `<Breadcrumbs />` component and will be output when the `render()` method is executed.

## Mobile Width Adaptation

The breadcrumb component switches to a single previous step link when the screen is collapsed or zoomed smaller than 481 device pixels or a custom `props.mobileWidth` declaration. This adaptation is designed to minizime the breadcrumb's footprint on smaller screens and is beneficial for sites with many layers.

## Optional Props

### ariaLabel (STRING)

Passing prop `ariaLabel="<STRING>"` to the `<Breadcrumbs />` component will override the default `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` declaration. If you plan to add a unique aria-label, please consider testing with one or more assistive devices to ensure proper context.

### className (STRING)

Passing prop `className="<STRING STRING>"` to the `<Breadcrumbs />` component will append your space-separated classes to the `<nav class="va-nav-breadcrumbs">` class list.

### id (STRING)

Passing prop `id="<STRING>"` to the `<Breadcrumbs />` component will append that ID to the `<nav>` element. If no `id` is passed, a unique id will be created by concatnating the string `va-breadcrumbs-` with a string returned by `lodash.uniqueid`.

### listId (STRING)

Passing prop `listId="<STRING>"` to the `<Breadcrumbs />` component will append that list ID to the `<ul>` element. If no `listId` is passed, a unique id will be created by concatnating the string `va-breadcrumbs-list-` with a string returned by `lodash.uniqueid`.

### mobileFirst (BOOLEAN)

Passing prop `mobileFirstProp` to the `<Breadcrumbs />` component will add a class `va-nav-breadcrumbs--mobile` to the `<nav>` element, and hide all breadcrumb links except the previous step. This prop could be used in cases where developers want absolute control over which breadcrumb UI to show, instead of letting the user's viewport width toggle the correct view.

## Accessibility

The `<Breadcrumbs />` component has been tested for accessibility. It is fully keyboard accessible, and announces the current page correctly in the following screen reader combinations:

* MacOS + Safari + VoiceOver
* MacOS + Chrome + VoiceOver
* iOS + Safari + VoiceOver
* Windows 7/10 + Firefox + NVDA
* Windows 10 + Chrome + NVDA
* Windows 7/10 + IE11 + JAWS
* Windows 10 + Chrome + JAWS

### aria-label (ATTRIBUTE)

The `<Breadcrumbs />` component automatically adds an `aria-label="Breadcrumb"` attribute to the containing `<nav>` element. This will be read out as "Breadcrumb" to assistive devices like JAWS, NVDA, and VoiceOver. The label can be changed to fit your needs by passing a custom string to the `ariaLabel` prop.

### aria-current (ATTRIBUTE)

The `<Breadcrumbs />` component automatically adds an `aria-current="page"` attribute to the last link rendered by the full breadcrumb list. This attribute triggers an `a[aria-current="page"]` CSS selector, makes the link bold, removes the underline, and changes it to a black text color. Current [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/NOTE-wai-aria-practices-1.1-20171214/examples/breadcrumb/index.html) recommend this `aria-current="page"` attribute for screen reader context.

### Code:

  {[
    <a href="#" key="1">Home</a>,
    <a href="#" key="2">Level One</a>,
    <a href="#" key="3">Level Two</a>
  ]}
</Breadcrumbs>
```

### Rendered Component
<div className="site-c-reactcomp__rendered">
  <Breadcrumbs>
    {[
      <a href="#" key="1">Home</a>,
