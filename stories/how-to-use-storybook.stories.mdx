# How to use Storybook
For the most part, Storybook is pretty intuitive to use, but there are some
things that may not be immediately obvious.

## Using the responsive viewport
What to see what a component does on mobile? Storybook has a tool for that!

When viewing [a
story](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/whats-a-story), there's a
toolbar at the top of the page. The furthest icon to the right is the responsive
viewport tool. Click it to open a menu to change the viewport for the story.

## Searching for stories
Can't find what you're looking for? Use Storybook's search bar! It's located in
the upper left corner of the page.

## Usage documents
Have questions about _when_ to use a component? We have usage documents
designed to answer that question and more!

You'll find these documents side-by-side with the components you want to learn
about. They're the orange paper icons like this <img src={usageDocImage}
alt="usage document icon" />.
