# Welcome to VSP's Storybook Pilot!

First, let's set some expectations: This is currently not considered the source
of truth. For that, go to [our documentation
site](https://department-of-veterans-affairs.github.io/veteran-facing-services-tools/visual-design).
We plan to update this regularly in preparation for a full migration to
[design.va.gov](https://design.va.gov/components).

In the meantime, please take a look around! Kick the tires, see how you like it.

To guard our limited bandwidth, we're holding off on answering questions for
now, but we'll have a proper introduction to our new documentation later. Our
plan is to do some user research on this, so if you're interested in giving us
feedback, please let us know in #vsp-design-system and we'll put you on the
list.

Enjoy!
