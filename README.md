# Component library
![Publishing workflow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)
![Latest version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library)

This is a monorepo containing two main packages:

- `react-components`
- `web-components`

The `core` package is for bundling the two main packages into one for publishing. The `storybook` package is for the combined story files from each `*-components` package.

## Publishing

### Updating the version

To publish changes from the `react-components` subpackage, make sure the version number in `packages/react-components/package.json` _and_ the version number in `packages/core/package.json` have been updated to be one ahead of the published versions.

To publish changes from the `web-components` subpackage, make sure the version number in `packages/web-components/package.json` _and_ the version number in `packages/core/package.json` have been updated to be one ahead of the published versions.

### How to choose a version number

This repo follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Here are some examples of which changes correspond to which version (MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH) increase.

#### Major
- Component is removed
- Component API is changed

#### Minor
- New component is added
- New variant is added for a component

### Patch
- Accessibility fix
- Styling fix

### Releasing
If the version numbers have been updated in `master` and you're ready to publish, [draft a new release](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library/releases) where the tag follows the [`vX.Y.Z` semantic versioning structure](https://semver.org/). This tag should match the version found in `packages/core/package.json`. Be sure to include good release notes describing the changes - GitHub's autogenerated release notes can be helpful.

Once a release is created, an attempt will be made to automatically publish the package(s) to npm using a GitHub action.

# Running Build via Storybook

    1. `yarn install`
    2. `yarn build`
2. `cd ../react-components/`
    1. `yarn install`
    2. `yarn build`
3. `cd ../core/`
    1. `yarn install`
    2. `yarn build`
4. `cd ../storybook/`
    1. `yarn install`

This will allow you to run Storybook locally to view all components
