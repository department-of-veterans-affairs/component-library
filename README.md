# Component library
![Publishing workflow](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library/actions/workflows/publish.yml/badge.svg)

This is a monorepo containing two main packages:

- `react-components`
- `web-components`

The `core` package is for bundling the two main packages into one for publishing. The `storybook` package is for the combined story files from each `*-components` package.

## Contributing

### Branch naming
This repo uses [`Chromatic`](https://www.chromatic.com/) to streamline reviews by publishing your changes and allowing reviewers to see them online. Do not use `/` in your branch name as Chromatic doesn't support it and will result in broken links.

## Publishing

### Updating the version

To publish changes from the `react-components` subpackage, make sure the version number in `packages/react-components/package.json` _and_ the version number in `packages/core/package.json` have been updated to be one ahead of the published versions.

To publish changes from the `web-components` subpackage, make sure the version number in `packages/web-components/package.json` _and_ the version number in `packages/core/package.json` have been updated to be one ahead of the published versions.

[`yarn version`](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/version) is available to use to make changes in the CLI. To change the version of the package you are working on run one of the following commands: `yarn version major`, `yarn version minor`, or `yarn version patch`. For guidance on which command to use please see below.

### How to choose a version number

This repo follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Here are some examples of which changes correspond to which version (MAJOR, MINOR, or PATCH) increase.

#### Major
- Component is removed
- Component API is changed

#### Minor
- New component is added
- New variant is added for a component

### Patch
- Accessibility fix
- Styling fix

### Releasing
If the version numbers have been updated in `master` and you're ready to publish, [draft a new release](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library/releases) where the tag follows the [`vX.Y.Z` semantic versioning structure](https://semver.org/). This tag should match the version found in `packages/core/package.json`. Be sure to include good release notes describing the changes - GitHub's autogenerated release notes can be helpful.

Once a release is created, an attempt will be made to automatically publish the package(s) to npm using a GitHub action.
