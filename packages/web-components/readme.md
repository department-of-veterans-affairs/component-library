# Veterans Affairs Web Components

This package contains all of the actively maintained web components used by the Veterans Affairs Design System (VADS). 

For more information about the VADS, checkout [design.va.gov](design.va.gov). 

For component documentation, checkout [our storybook](design.va.gov/storybook).

## Stencil
Our web components are built with [stencil](https://stenciljs.com/). 

Stencil is a compiler for building fast web apps using Web Components.

Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular frontend frameworks into a compile-time rather than run-time tool.  Stencil takes TypeScript, JSX, a tiny virtual DOM layer, efficient one-way data binding, an asynchronous rendering pipeline (similar to React Fiber), and lazy-loading out of the box, and generates 100% standards-based Web Components that run in any browser supporting the Custom Elements v1 spec.

Stencil components are just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.

## Getting Started

To start building a new web component using Stencil, first cd into `packages/web-components`.

Run:

```bash
yarn install
```

There are two ways this project can be run for development. 

For developing and testing with storybook, follow [these steps](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/component-library?tab=readme-ov-file#running-build-via-storybook). 

For just running the stencil dev server, ensure your working directory is still `packages/web-components` and then run `yarn serve`. 

If just running the stencil dev server, after creating and naming your component, add it to `src/index.html` so the dev server picks it up. Remove the `<my-component />` dummy component from index.html 

To build for production, run:

```bash
yarn run build
```

To run the unit tests for the components, run:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Naming Components

All Veterans Affairs web components are prefixed with `va-`. Some components have variations. In these instances, a variation will be appended to the original component's name. For example: 
```html
// Original component
<va-button />
// Variations
<va-button-icon />
<va-button-pair />
```
