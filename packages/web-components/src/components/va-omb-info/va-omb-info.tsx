          been authorized under the Privacy Act of 1974 or title 38, Code of
          Federal Regulations, section 1.576 for routine uses (e.g., the VA
          sends educational forms or letters with a veteran’s identifying
          information to the Veteran’s school or training establishment to (1)
          assist the veteran in the completion of claims forms or (2) for the VA
          to obtain further information as may be necessary from the school for
          VA to properly process the Veteran’s education claim or to monitor his
          or her progress during training) as identified in the VA system of

          Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Records - VA, and published
          in the Federal Register. Your obligation to respond is required to
          obtain or retain
          {this.benefitType}. Giving us your SSN account information is
          voluntary. Refusal to provide your SSN by itself will not result in
          the denial of benefits. The VA will not deny an individual benefits
          for refusing to provide his or her SSN unless the disclosure of the
          SSN is required by a Federal Statute of law enacted before January 1,
          1975, and still in effect. The requested information is considered
          relevant and necessary to determine the maximum benefits under the
          law. While you do not have to respond, VA cannot process your claim
          for education assistance unless the information is furnished as
          required by existing law (38 U.S.C. 3471). The responses you submit
          are considered confidential (38 U.S.C. 5701). Any information provided
          by applicants, recipients, and others may be subject to verification
