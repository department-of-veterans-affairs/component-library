# css-library

The purpose of the CSS Library is to replace the current VA.gov style library (Formation) with styles and tokens based on [USWDS version 3](https://github.com/uswds/uswds). 

## Generate all files

To generate all tokens, stylesheets, and assets, run `yarn build`

## Stylesheets

To generate stylesheets, run `yarn build:stylesheets`

## Design Tokens

To generate all token files, run `yarn build:tokens`

The tokens generated by this library will be available in several different formats so that various tools and environments can use them.
