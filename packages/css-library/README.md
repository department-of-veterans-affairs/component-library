# css-library

## Stylesheets

The stylesheets generated by this library are based on [USWDS version 3](https://github.com/uswds/uswds) and are intended to eventually replace the Formation CSS library:

- fonts.css
- elements.css
- utilties.css

To generate stylesheets, run `yarn build:stylesheets` or `yarn build:minify`

## Design Tokens

The tokens generated by this library will be available in several different formats so that various tools and environments can use them.

To generate CSS token files, run `yarn build:tokens`
