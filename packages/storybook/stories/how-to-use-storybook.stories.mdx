# How to use Storybook

## Searching for stories

Can't find what you're looking for? Use Storybook's search bar! It's located in
the upper left corner of the page.

## Canvas

The Canvas view allows you to see a component story in isolation from other stories while providing information and playground functionality.
It's comprised of a toolbar located at the top of the page, the component story and addons.
You can hover over each toolbar icon to view a short description of what it does.

You can get to Canvas view from a component story page by clicking the Canvas tab from a component story page.

### Toolbar

The Canvas toolbar provides you with a variety of tools such as zoom controls, toggling between a light and dark background, changing the viewport size and orientation,
measuring component dimensions, applying an outline to elements, a color filter to simulate visual impairments, and utility and convenience tools.

The **zoom tools** allow you to zoom in, zoom out or reset the zoom. This allows you to see the component at different zoom levels while only affecting the component.

The **background tool** allows you to see how components look on a light or dark background. A clear background option appears if a background is selected.

The **viewport tools** allow you to change the viewport size and orientation to see how a component renders at different breakpoints.

The **measure tool** allows you to hover over an element and view information about its height, width, padding and margin.

The **outline tool** applies outlines to elements in the component.

The **color filter tool** simulates how the component looks for users with vision impairments.

These utility and convenience tools allow you to view the story in full screen, view the component in complete isolation on a new tab or copy a link to the story with your selected settings.

### Addons

If you don't see the Addons section, please make sure **Show addons** is selected and click on **Change addons orientation** as shown here.

The **Controls** tab allows you to modify a component's properties and view its properties and events. The story will update to reflect new values for the properties if changed. This also exists in **Docs** view.

The **Story** tab displays the source code for the full story. You can use this to understand how we're using a component in a story.

The **HTML** tab displays the HTML markup for the story. You can use this to understand how to use a component or click **Copy** to copy the full story for your convenience.

The **Accessibility** tab shows you the results of automated accessibility checks performed for a story. You can click through the results to learn more about each test.
