# Welcome to the VSP Design System Storybook!

Here, you'll find the design system components available for use. Check out the
navigation in the left panel for that list. Each component will have one or more
"stories" on it so you can see the various states it can have.

If you have any questions or suggestions on how we might improve this, please
reach out to us in #vsp-design-system.

Enjoy!

# Maturity Scale

The maturity scale indicates the level of maturity of each component and pattern in the system. It helps designers and developers know if they should use the component and what level of caution they should have when doing so.
